				<h2>My goals for the next 2 years</h2>
				<p>
					Over the next two years, I have several goals that I want to achieve
					in the tech field. These goals are important to me because I want to
					become a very good and successful developer. I believe I can build a
					strong foundation for my career by working hard to achieve them.
				</p>
				<p>
					I want to learn new programming languages. Knowing multiple languages
					will make me a more versatile developer and open up more job
					opportunities. To achieve this, I plan to take online courses and
					practice by building small projects. Participating in coding
					challenges will also help me improve my skills and learn new
					techniques.
				</p>
				<p>
					I aim to improve my current skills. As a developer, it's important to
					keep getting better and building more efficient and effective
					applications. I will work on more complex projects, get feedback from
					my peers, and mentor, and stay updated with the latest tech trends.
					This way, I can ensure that I am always improving and staying relevant
					in the industry.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another important goal I have is to build a strong portfolio. A
					portfolio showcases my skills to potential employers or clients,
					making it easier to find job opportunities. I will create and host
					personal projects on GitHub and write about them in a blog.
					Additionally, contributing to open-source projects will help me gain
					more experience and improve my portfolio.
				</p>
				<p>
					Networking with other developers is also a key goal for me. By
					connecting with others, I can learn from their experiences, find job
					opportunities, and stay motivated. I plan to attend meetups, join
					online communities, and connect with people on LinkedIn. Building a
					strong network will support my growth and help me stay engaged in the
					tech community.
				</p>
				<p>
					Getting a developer job or freelancing is another major goal. Gaining
					real-world experience is essential for starting my career as a
					developer. I will apply for jobs, reach out to potential clients, and
					continuously improve my skills to stand out in the job market. Whether
					I work for a company or take on freelance projects, I want to gain as
					much experience as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					I want to stay consistent and motivated throughout this journey.
					Achieving my goals requires steady progress and dedication. I will set
					small, achievable goals, track my progress, and celebrate my
					milestones. By staying focused and motivated, I can ensure that I am
					always moving forward and getting closer to my dreams.
